## About The Project

![unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36031708/161927828-b09b6184-6832-463c-b337-86ea771c87a4.png)


This project intends to be a simplistic simulation of a small city. The user can play with differents values to see how they impact the simulation after each (simulated) days.
The population have needs satisfied by goods. A portion of the populations works to create those goods. Depending on how much the population's needs are satisfied, a global happiness is calculated. If it's high enough, the popluation will grow. If it's too low it will reduce.
